<p>This shitty game is one of my most hated things in my life but I
still want to improve because the humilliation of lose is so big that I
can not support it. This is a small guide of how to understand this
diabolic game and play decently.</p>
<p>I am far away of being a good player on chess, but I consider that I
am good enough to get some wins.</p>
<p>For this guide you need to use a
<a href="https://lichess.org/analysis">virtual board</a> to figure some
stuff. In general you need to understand the rules of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rules_of_chess">how to play
chess</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_notation_(chess)">algebraic
chess notation</a>.</p>

<h1 id="rules-of-chess"># Rules of chess</h1>
<h2 id="memorize-everything-you-can">## MEMORIZE EVERYTHING YOU CAN</h2>
<p>This is a memory and pattern recognition game. There is no magic
here. It is not a guru’s game or stuff like that. Is a skill that you
will get practicing, losing a big amount of games and practicing alone.
Use <a href="https://lichess.org">Lichess</a> to play.</p>
<h2 id="you-have-to-checkmate-your-oponent-the-fastest-way-possible">##
You have to checkmate your oponent the fastest way possible:</h2>
<p>Always search for a checkmate to the enemy pieces. Do not lose time
in other distractions, like eating other pieces or get in better
position when you can checkmate.</p>
<h2 id="the-game-is-repetitive-and-always-the-same-stuff">## The game is
repetitive and always the same stuff</h2>
<p>Once you learn the basic tactics that I will present you above, the
rest of the game is pattern recognition about what it comes next.</p>
<h2 id="calculate">## Calculate</h2>
<p>When you are about to move a piece, watch the future about possible
movements and ALWAYS select the most destructive path that can happen to
you. The other player wants to win too. At least 3 or 4 possible ways
with at least 4 or 5 movements per line. Calculate more if it is a hard
opponent.</p>
<h2 id="do-not-go-to-clickbait-guides">## Do not go to clickbait
guides</h2>
<p>There exist a big ammount of shitty stuff on internet. Chess is not
the exception. If you want to improve, just play unranked games on
Lichess and select the biggest elo players that Lichess will let you
play. The only way to learn something, is by exposition. Another
resource is wikipedia chess articles and if you are advanced enough and
have a elephant memory, use
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Modern-Chess-Openings-15th-Firmian/dp/0812936825">Modern
Chess Openings</a> book to learn openings. The only way to learn tactics
is by repetition. No more science.</p>
<h2 id="all-your-movements-has-double-intentions">## ALL YOUR MOVEMENTS
HAS DOUBLE INTENTIONS</h2>
<p>Do not make a move with one posibility to happen. You will extremely
lose every game if you do not make bait moves, traps, or stuff that will
confuse or make optionless your opponent. Absolutely all your movements
has to make another thing if your original plan does not work as you
expected.</p>
<h1 id="tactics"># Tactics</h1>
<p>They are patterns that happen often in the game. You have to memorize
a good amount of this strategies and apply them when you can see them
when you are playing.</p>
<p>Wikipedia has a good ammount of resources on definitions of tactics.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Chess_tactics">Use
it</a>.</p>
<h1 id="openings"># Openings</h1>
<p>You will not have to learn much about openings at the begining, but
in essence this are movements that theoretically are the best for your
game in function of the movements that your opponent do.</p>
<p>It is hard to make a good guide to openings, so I can not gave any
opinion on that. The most that I can say is to learn the basic of an
opening and understand where is attacking, where is deffending,
responses to some movements and the rest is up to you.</p>
<h2 id="resources">## Resources</h2>
<ol type="a">
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Modern-Chess-Openings-15th-Firmian/dp/0812936825">Modern
Chess Openings</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Chess_Opening_Theory">chess
opening theory</a> from Wikibooks.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_opening">Wikipedia’s
openings article</a>. Take a look to their other opening articles too as
you lurk.</li>
<li>Youtube videos about an specific opening.</li>
</ol>
<p>Do not think too much about openings. Soon or late you will play some
openings without knowing about it. You will memorize some of then
because you will lose so much on some opening traps that you will
remember the correct line to continue playing.</p>
<h1 id="endgame"># Endgame</h1>
<p>When no plan that you build has worked before, then the punishment
continues in this last but not painless situation. The endgame. Here you
will try to get a passed pawn and promote to a queen, destroy some of
the two flanks of your rival and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_chess#simplify">simplify</a>
your position to make your opponent with less options to destroy you. In
the endgame you will have some of your pawns and one of this
configuration of pieces: a) TODO: Put pieces configurations</p>
<h1 id="how-can-you-practice"># How can you practice?</h1>
<p>Use <a href="https://lichess.org">unranked lichess games</a> and
<a href="https://chesstempo.com">chesstempo</a> to practice tactics
(here are a good amount of good problems). You can use lichess problems
too, but chesstempo in general is better, that is what internet say.</p>

</div>
<div class="mdtext" style="flex:1; margin-right: 1rem;">
<p>Here are some secret tactics that you can use to win any chess game
and will be useful for you to win that opponent that is completely
stronger than you.</p>
<h2 id="eat-the-pieces">Eat the pieces</h2>
<p>When you can, take advantage of your oponent distraction and grab a
piece and eat it. Try to grab the easiest to digest like a tower or a
pawn. At first will hurt you, but your need to win will make you
tolerate the pain.</p>
<h2 id="use-stockfish-in-your-mobile">Use stockfish in your mobile</h2>
<p>Install lichess and start an analysis board and do all the movements
that are happening in the board. Then, select the movement that
stockfish says that will get you better chances to win. Use your phone
wisely and try to excuse you that your girlfriend, a mother or something
that looks important to you needs your attention on the phone. You can
win a match if you do it wisely.</p>
<h2 id="distract-your-enemy">Distract your enemy</h2>
<p>Try to put pressure to make a choose. Say stuff that can
deconcentrate, making laugh them or anything that is useful to make them
lose control on their abilities of playing the game. Useful in unranked
games and IRL encounters.</p>
