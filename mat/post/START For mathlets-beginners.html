<p>This is a small guide useful for someone that does not know much or
simply does not know nothing about the subject. Here I will try to
explain how to start understanding this subject, how to think about it
and how to learn more about math with the help of internet.</p>
<p>This will not make you a mathematician or something similar. Is for
someone that want to learn math as a hobby. If you want to be a
professional, you will have to go to university and check your knowledge
there.</p>
<p>Here you will learn how to be skilled enough to enjoy learning
theorems, get some results and apply them for stuff that you are
interested (programming, numerical stuff, geometry, etc). Allways as a
enthusiast.</p>
<h1 id="what-is-mathematics"># What is mathematics?</h1>
<p>This is a personal appreciation. For me, math is the study of the
description of a phenomena or called mathematical theory, which given
some axioms (they are propositions that are true because are
convenient), some signs and rules for those signs in function of the
axioms, giving results (called theorems) using a chain of logic
think.</p>
<p>This science is purely deductive. All the results that has been
obtained, are from a chain of provable affirmations using previous
knowledgement at difference of biology or medicine, which results are
using testing/error scenarios and comparing the hypothesis and the
obtained result.</p>
<p>It has a lot of social interaction and communication because the main
idea is communicate the events that has been proved via theorems using
the previous axioms from a mathematical theory. This allowed all the
great amount of free knowledge we can have online from different
resources online.</p>
<h1 id="how-to-learn-math"># How to learn math?</h1>
<p>This is not any kind of magic or unintelligible amount of stuff for
two or tree guys that enjoy talk about nothing. It is an obtainable
skill like any other, only that will take you a good amount of time. It
can change your life and the way you see and learn about stuff. In my
case it was positive, but do not forget where you have started. An
ignorant, like all we were, in one or another way.</p>
<p>If you have done any kind of serious work on learn a impressive skill
(music, philosophy, art, sports), you know that you did not start and
you where good from the beginning. And if it was, probably from kid you
expressed interest in some of that skills, trying to immitate the people
that you admire, and soon or later, get a better cognition in that
aptitude.</p>
<p>This is the same stuff. You will need a basic guide where to check
stuff, read about topics you do not know, solve exercises that you do
not know how to attack, search topics that are relevant to what you want
to learn, repeat.</p>
<p>In a year or two, you can get decent to learn anything from your own
means. Does not matter how much time you invest in this. Is in the
quality time that you invest.</p>
<h1 id="ok.-so-how-i-start"># Ok. So, how I start?</h1>
<p>You will need to read books and lurk internet in general. The best
source of knowledge are books because they were revised and analysed for
errors and issues, trying to reduce the problems when you read about a
topic.</p>
<p>Math books are not like a novel or similar literature. They are not
pretended to read linearly. You can skip chapters, even the book if you
learn what you needed or you were interested. They are written in a
really simple format that you will memorize easily.</p>
<ul>
<li>Preface: Will tell you the motivation that gave the author to write
his work. Usually will tell you what the book will talk about.</li>
<li>Table of contents: selfexplained.</li>
<li>Chapters: The first chapters, probably the first, if not has made an
explicit chapter called “prerequisites” or similar, will tell you the
notation and facts that the book will use so you can understand what the
author tries to explain you.</li>
<li>Appendix: Extra info that can be useful or not, depends on your
interest on learning more or not about x or y topic on the book.</li>
<li>Index: This will be a main tool that if you do not remember some
terminology defined or theorem that you will need to use for the part
where you are reading, you can search there to not get loss and to
refresh memory in general.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the basic core that you will need to know for learn any
mathematical stuff by your own.</p>
<ul>
<li>Basic Mathematics by Lang.</li>
<li>Calculus by Spivak.</li>
<li>Mathematical Analysis I and II by Zorich. (Use the first one as a
complement of Spivak’s Calculus book)</li>
<li>Linear Algebra by Hoffman and Kunze.</li>
<li>Functions of One Complex Variable I by Conway.</li>
<li>Calculus on Manifolds by Spivak or Analysis on Manifolds by
Munkres.</li>
<li>Differential Geometry of Curves and Surfaces by Tapp</li>
<li>Abstract Algebra by Dummit and Foote.</li>
<li>Topology by Munkres (only the first part of point set
topology).</li>
</ul>
<p>Obviously, some topics will need you another complementary topic, but
you will be able to learn it searching in the web or looking at the
bibliography that are at the end of the book.</p>
<p>This books will teach you about: * Analysis in Rn * Complex analysis
* Linear Algebra in a field * Abstract Algebra (Algebraic Structures) *
Differential Geometry * Point set Topology</p>
<p>With this core, you can understand other books that are more complex
or abstract in nature.</p>
<h1 id="where-can-i-search-more-stuff"># Where can I search more
stuff?</h1>
<p>If you want to learn more because you liked it, you can lurk
Wikipedia’s
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Mathematics">math
portal</a>. You will find a lot of links to more stuff that you probably
do not know nothing about, or barely little. If you talk any other
language, you will and must know, that english is the only way to learn
advanced topics because is the actual international language of
communication. Use english Wikipedia.</p>
<p>There are some good guide online for where you can go from here too.
Search online about.</p>
<p>Search a syllabus of an university and search the bibliography that
they use. Check online notes from teachers. A good amount of teachers
has online notes and more interesting stuff if you want to continue
learning.</p>
<p><a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/">MIT OpenCourseWare</a> has recorded
classes about a really good amount of math topics too. I did not use it
them enough because I prefer reading books, but I know that it is useful
for other people.</p>
